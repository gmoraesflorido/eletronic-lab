# 📌 Electronic Lab

This repository is designed to **enhance communication and streamline code exchanges** among team members during this semester's projects.

## ⚡ Best Practices

To maintain a clean and structured codebase, follow these guidelines:

### 📁 Python File Structure
Each file should adhere to the following structure:
1. **Imports** → Organized in three distinct groups:
   - Native Python modules.
   - External libraries installed via `pip`.
   - Internal imports from this repository.
2. **Main Function (`main()`)** → Should remain **simple**, containing only:
   - Conditional validations.
   - Constant handling.
   - A maximum of **two** loop structures (`for` or `while`).
3. **`if __name__ == "__main__"` Block** → Essential for modularization and proper script argument configuration.

By following these best practices, we ensure **consistency, clarity, and ease of maintenance** throughout the semester! 🚀
